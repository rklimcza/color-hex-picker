# color-hex-picker
Very simple tool, useful for graphic designers who need to have quick access to rgb color codes. Powered by Bootstrap and ZeroClipboard

ZeroClipboard will not function when opened from Local Disc - you have to open from server (can be localhost)

In future I want to add PHP UI for this script.
